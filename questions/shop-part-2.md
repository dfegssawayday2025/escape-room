Shop Alien: Thanks for your help, but I've still got a huge problem - my boss is part Zenomorph, and colour blind, and if he can't read the graph properly he'll be very annoyed.

Frederick: I think you need the afcharts package for R: it uses the Government Analysis Function accessible colour palette by default.
Shop Alien: Thank you! The future's bright the future's...
Frederick: Dark blue I think.

Look at the Government Analysis Function guidance:

What is the hex code for dark blue?
