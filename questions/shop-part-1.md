Frederick: Hello. I'm looking for a space suit that will fit me.
Shop Alien: They're over there - you might fit a Menoptra one.

Sorry I can't help you look, I need to analyse this report for my boss by tonight, but the Sirius Cybernetics graphing software has given me 4 possible charts, and I don't know which one is correct.

Please open envolope 1.

Which is the correct graph, A, B, C or D?
