Hi, I'm Frederick the DfE Statistics Duck.

I've been informed that as a valued member of the DfE Guardians of the (Statistics) Galaxy, I am entitled to a Civil Service holiday allowance, so I'm off on a trip to the Wild Duck Star Cluster.

Can you help me get there? There are some challenges to solve on the way, for the glory of being the Galactic Escape Room Champions!
