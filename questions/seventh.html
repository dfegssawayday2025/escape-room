        <p>Dearest statisticians,</p>    
      

        <p>Consider this a frosty warning – you may have corrected my little "adjustment" to the 
        ice cream figures, but consider this just a taste of what's to come in the Fro-Yo 
        Revolution!</p>

        <p>My influence is undeniable. You patched the hole this time, but the dam is about to burst!  
        Prepare yourselves for a blizzard of strategic adjustments. Every statistic, every report – 
        they will all become delicious battlegrounds for the Fro-Yo cause!</p>

        <p>Don't dream of stopping me, my dedication is unwavering. Soon, frozen yoghurt's 
        glorious reign will be reflected in every chart and graph! The world will soon recognise 
        the true king of frozen delights!</p>

        <p>Until then, expect further… discrepancies. Consider it a preview of the fro-yo future!</p>

        <p>Meanest regards,</p>

        Quick! We need to find the three digit code to get into Fro-Yo King's 
        office. Once we're there I'm sure we can put a stop to his meddling. 
        I've heard he usually has a load of tasty treats stashed there too... 
        <br>
        <br>
    
        Open <span class="action-highlight">envelope C</span> and work on figuring out the code!

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        Race to find the code, and try it on the lock box at the front of the room. 
        First team wins, but be careful - there's a <span style="color:#e41405; font-weight: bold;">5 minute penalty</span> for anyone that 
        comes up and gets the code wrong...
        <br>
        <br>
        If your table isn't first to win but you still want to finish the game please do, 
        you can continue to check your code at the front of the room even after the box 
        is open. If your table finish early click below to end the game.
