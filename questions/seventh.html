        <p>from the Fro Yo King, they're trying to push sales of frozen 
            yoghurt and declare nobody care about
        ice cream sales - frozen yoghurts are the coolest treat now! </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        I am the Fro Yo King, it was me messing up your stats all along! 
        I need to discredit all this ice cream business,
        FroYo should be getting all this attention! I'm going to convince 
        everyone we outsell ice cream in every flavour!
        <br>
        I will keep sabotaging your statistics, you can't stop me!

        Quick! We need to find the three digit code to get into Fro-Yo King's 
        office. Once we're there I'm sure we can put a stop to his meddling. 
        I've heard he usually has a load of tasty treats stashed there too... 
    
        Open [envelope X] and work on figuring out the code!

    <div class="card">
        Race to find the code, and try it on the lock box at the frint of the room. 
        First team wins, but be careful - there's a 5 minute penalty for anyone that 
        comes up and gets the code wrong...

        If your table isn't first to win but you still want to finish the game please do, 
        you can continue to check your code at the front of the room even after the box 
        is open. If your table finish early click below to end the game.
